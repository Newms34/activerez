# ActiveRez

An interactive resume making app.

*NOTE!* This is still VERY much under construction!

## Installation.

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed (use the LTS version). 
2. Download this repo (`git clone` or download the .zip and extract if you don't have a github (shame on you)).
3. Navigate into the project folder, open a terminal, and run: `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `gulp build && npm start` to start em!


NOTE: you need Mongodb installed for this to work.
